    "This is getting into the weeds, so feel free to skip it, but if you are at all confused about the difference between a `type` and a `class`, this section will try to provide a little clarity (or make you more confused).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python 2, the built-in types like `int`, `float`, `list`, etc., were more different from user-defined [custom classes](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#custom-classes) than they are in Python 3, but starting in [Python 2.2.3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.2.3/descrintro/) they were unified (mostly?). Now, if you make your own class named `MyClass`, then (unless you use a [metaclass](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#metaclasses)) `type(int) == type(MyClass)`. In fact, the types are not just equal, `type(int) is type(MyClass)` because `type(int) is type` and `type(MyClass) is type`. As we said above, a class object can be used to create instances of the class. Well, every object is an instance of a class (or multiple classes, through inheritance), so class objects are instances of a [metaclass](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#metaclasses), and the default metaclass is [type](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#metaclasses). In fact, type is the mother of all metaclasses, in that for ***every*** object `x`, `isinstance(type(x), type)` is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in function [type( )](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type) returns the type of an object, which according to the documentation at that link is ***generally the same object as returned by*** `object.__class__`, which is the name of the class used to instantiate the object. The `type` of the object ***is*** its `class`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll discuss ***[classes](#classes)*** much later, but you can create your own user-defined class using a [class definition](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-definition-syntax). The object created by a class definition is referred to as a ***class object***, just like the object created by a function definition is  referred to as a ***function object***, but there is a confusing difference: the type of the function object is `function`, whereas the type of the class object is `type`. There is no `class` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all of this is confusing, it would probably be best to think of ***type*** and ***class*** as synonyms for now, while keeping in mind the difference in syntax: the  built-in function [type( )](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type) returns the type of an object, whereas user-defined classes are created with a [class definition](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#class).\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, the \"built-in function\" `type( )` is ***not*** a function object, it ***is*** the metaclass object `type`, which when called with one argument returns the type of an object as stated earlier, but when called with three arguments creates a new instance of type type, i.e. a class!  This can be used for dynamic creation of class objects."

Besides returning a value, functions can also execute any desired code.\n",
